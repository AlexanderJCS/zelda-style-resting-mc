# Zelda Style Resting

A Minecraft 1.21.11 datapack that enables zelda-style resting, like campfires in Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom.

This datapack may work for other versions of Minecraft, but it's not guaranteed.

How to use:
- Be near a campfire and run the commands:
  - `/function rest:morning`, `/function rest:noon`, or `/function rest:night`
